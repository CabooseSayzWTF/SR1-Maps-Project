# Mode Info<br>
Mark Finished Beside The Mode Type When It's Finished<br>
The maps may need xtbl's for respawns, navs, & vehicles but unsure!, you prob have to name the xtbl's along the name of the cts for the mode.<br>
I have supplied strings files, and the multiplayer_levels/maps file. The multiplayer_levels file may need tweaked for customizable_weapons/customizable_vehicles for the maps.
Idk what those two lines of code mean so as is they are set to 0 for all custom maps. Please adjust as needed tho!<br>

If you want any of these 7 maps in GB/TGB/BAC/TBAC/PTP<br>
I need the cts files for them.<br>
-- Coop and BOR stuff will come in later releases! So please, nobody focus on Coop or BOR till every<br>
