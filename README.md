# Info For The Public<br>
This has been a very very long project in the works and it was just never finished. Time isn't on our side like planned. <br>
Everybody involved kept going there own ways and doing there own things. Granted I'm greatful for the help along the way.<br>
Alot of maps were cut from this project and alot of maps were migrated to be LOBBY ONLY maps. With that said, this<br>
is still very much unfinished. Read below for current progress. This may get updated in time but idk. So I'm making this repo public.<br>
Maybe the community will eventually do something with this and maybe not. This project was migrated to be xenia/rgh only.<br>
It was made to be this way mostly because well, it's hard to keep retail console compatibility without alot of sacrifices.<br>
On another note most maps now have majority of textures and better map images to reflect these changes.<br>

# Mode Info<br>
Mark Finished Beside The Mode Type When It's Finished<br>
The maps may need xtbl's for respawns, navs, & vehicles but unsure!, you prob have to name the xtbl's along the name of the cts for the mode.<br>
I have supplied strings files, and the multiplayer_levels/maps file. The multiplayer_levels file may need tweaked for customizable_weapons/customizable_vehicles for the maps.
Idk what those two lines of code mean so as is they are set to 0 for all custom maps. Please adjust as needed tho!<br>

Original Maps in Diff Modes -- This was not done yet<br>

1. Crunch Time (originates from ptp)<br>
2. Holding Pattern (originates from ptp)<br>

If you want any of these 7 maps in GB/TGB/BAC/TBAC/PTP<br>
I need the cts files for them.<br>
-- Coop and BOR stuff will come in later releases! So please, nobody focus on Coop or BOR till every<br>
other map, cts file, map image is tested. Adding more to the current list just puts us very behind.<br>
